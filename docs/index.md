___________________________________________________

Welcome to our series of tutorials on **Confidential Computing**! 

Our goal is to give **developpers** a better understanding of this amazing security technology. By the end of all the tutorials, you'll know how to **securely run an enclave**, **attest** it, **communicate** with it and **store** it.

We will start by explaining the current security challenges it can solve in the introduction. Then we'll move on to **practice** because we believe in **learning by coding**!

All the tutorials will be oriented toward implementing an application with Confidential Computing. We'll go over how to build it, show how it works and highlight the strengths and constraints.

- We recommend you do the tutorials in order - the whole structure has been thought like chapters in a book. 

- **Experience in C/C++ and Linux is required** to fully follow this series. 

- Some parts will require specific machines to be run, because Confidential Computing is a **hardware-based solution**. Weâ€™ll explain which ones and how to set them up at the beginning of the tutorials.
