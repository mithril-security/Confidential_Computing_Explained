# ðŸ”’ What is Confidential Computing?
___________________________________________________

As you might have guessed, there is an answer to the security issues mentioned in the last chapter: **Confidential Computing**! 

Our tutorialâ€™s star technology can analyze sensitive data **without ever exposing it in clear**. It does so by using **Trusted Execution Environments** (TEEs), hardware-based secure environments also sometimes referred to as **secure enclaves**. 

They are self-contained zones where the processor guarantees that the software running inside cannot be tampered with by the host operating system, hypervisor, and even its BIOS. The **memory isolation** provided by the hardware makes outside attempts to **read or modify fail**.

In the previous hospital scenario for instance, the AI startup could put their speech-to-text model inside an enclave. This would allow them to analyze the medical note recorded by the doctors, but without being able to technically see the hospitalâ€™s data!

The full process of how data is protected will be explained later in the series, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand the details yet!

Confidential Computing has been gaining more and more traction and is driven today by the main hardware providers. Intel initially proposed **Intel SGX** in 2014, to secure processes. They were followed by AMD with **SEV SNP** to deploy confidential VMs. And Nvidia will release **confidential GPUs** in 2023.

Itâ€™s an exciting time to learn about Confidential Computing! Weâ€™re happy to take you with us on this journey to learn **how to build confidential apps** ðŸš€
