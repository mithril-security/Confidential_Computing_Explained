# ðŸ”’ What is Confidential Computing?
___________________________________________________

As you might have guessed from the preivous chapter, there is an answer to those security issues and it is **Confidential Computing**! 

Our tutorialâ€™s star technology can analyze sensitive data **without ever exposing it in clear**. It does so by using **secure enclaves**.

Secure enclaves, or **Trusted Execution Environments** (TEEs), are hardware-based secure environments. They are self-contained zones where the processor guarantees that the software running inside cannot be tampered with by the host operating system, hypervisor, and even its BIOS. The **memory isolation** provided by the hardware makes outside attempts to **read or modify fail**.

In the previous hospital scenario for instance, the AI startup could have put their model inside an enclave. This would have allowed the medical recordings to be analyzed by the startup without them being technically able to see the hospitalâ€™s data!

The full process of how data is protected will be explained later in the series, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand the details yet!

Confidential Computing has been gaining more and more traction and is driven today by the main hardware providers. Intel initially proposed **Intel SGX** in 2014, to secure processes. They were followed by AMD with **SEV SNP** to deploy confidential VMs. And Nvidia will release **confidential GPUs** in 2023.

Itâ€™s an exciting time to learn about Confidential Computing! Weâ€™re happy to take you with us on this journey to learn **how to build confidential apps** ðŸš€
