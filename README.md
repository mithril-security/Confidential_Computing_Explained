# Confidential Computing Explained

*This series of tutorials has a nice website: [https://confidential-computing-explained.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/](https://confidential-computing-explained.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/)*

## A hands-on guide for beginners

Welcome to our series of tutorials on **Confidential Computing**! 

Our goal is to give **developpers** a better understanding of this amazing security technology. By the end of all the tutorials, you'll know how to **securely run an enclave**, **attest** it, **communicate** with it and **store** it.

We will go start by explaining the current security challenges it can solve in the introduction. Then we'll move on to **practice** because we believe in **learning by coding**!

## Follow the manual

All the tutorials will be oriented toward implementing an application with Confidential Computing. We'll go over how to build it, show how it works and highlight the strengths and constraints. 

- We recommend you do the tutorials in order - the whole structure has been thought like chapters in a book. 

- **Experience in C/C++ and Linux is required** to fully follow this series. 

- Some **intermediary knowledge of cryptography** is also needed

- Some parts will require specific machines to be run, because Confidential Computing is a **hardware-based solution**. Weâ€™ll explain which ones and how to set them up at the beginning of the tutorials.

## A technology on the rise

Confidential Computing has been gaining more and more traction and is driven today by the main hardware providers. Intel initially proposed Intel SGX in 2014, to secure processes. They were followed by AMD with SEV SNP to deploy confidential VMs. And Nvidia will release confidential GPUs in 2023.

Itâ€™s an exciting time to learn about Confidential Computing! Weâ€™re happy to take you with us on this journey to learn how to build confidential apps ğŸš€
